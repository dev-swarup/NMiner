# RandomX
RandomX is a proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm that is optimized for general-purpose CPUs. RandomX uses random code execution (hence the name) together with several memory-hard techniques to minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware.

# NMiner (Node.js Miner)
NMiner is built using node.js addon for unmatched performance with other miners. Using latest technologies for best hashrate possible.
